//diff between == and === 

//== -- abstract eqaultity operator
//=== -- strict equality operator

// both of them check the datatypes but in the == operator if the types are different it will  do the coersion(conversion of the types ). but in === operator it wil check the tyoes if the types are different it willl give you a false value.
